    "<p>The difference between a unique (key) constraint and a primary key constraint is that a primary key is a specific type of unique key. Both constraints enforce uniqueness of values in a column or set of columns, but they have different purposes and implications:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Unique (Key) Constraint:</strong> A unique constraint ensures that the values in a column or set of columns are unique, meaning no two rows can have the same value in the specified column(s). It allows for the presence of null values.</li>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Primary Key Constraint:</strong> A primary key constraint also enforces uniqueness, but it has additional properties. It not only requires unique values but also mandates that the specified column(s) do not contain null values. Additionally, a table can have only one primary key, and it is often used as the main identifier for the table's rows. This constraint is essential for data integrity and data relationships in a relational database.</li>\n",

    "<p>The difference between a column (data) type and a column's domain is as follows:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Column (Data) Type:</strong> The column type defines the data format or data structure that a column can hold, such as integers, strings, dates, or floating-point numbers. It specifies the category of data the column can store and sets constraints on the allowed values and operations for that column. For example, common column types include INT, VARCHAR, DATE, and DECIMAL.</li>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Column's Domain:</strong> The column's domain refers to the set of valid values that a column can take. It defines the range or constraints on the actual data values within the column. The domain is a broader concept that encompasses the data type, and it specifies the specific values or rules that data in the column must adhere to. For instance, a column's domain might include constraints like \"positive integers\" or \"valid email addresses.\" The domain helps define the semantics of the data within the column.</li>\n",

    "<u>Answer</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using DOUBLE is a reasonable choice for storing latitude and longitude values in most SQL databases since it allows for a wide range of precision. However, if you want to explore alternatives, consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "DECIMAL (also known as NUMERIC):\n",
    "\n",
    "DECIMAL is used for exact numeric data types, which are suitable for storing coordinates where precision is crucial. You can specify the exact number of digits to the right of the decimal point.\n",
    "For example, you can use DECIMAL(9, 6) to store latitude and longitude with 6 decimal places of precision, which is roughly equivalent to meters.\n",
    "Custom Data Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your database system, you may have the option to create custom data types. You could define a custom data type specifically for latitude and longitude, ensuring both are stored with the same precision.\n",
    "Vendor-Specific Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "Some database management systems offer vendor-specific data types optimized for geographic coordinates. For example, PostgreSQL has a built-in data type called POINT designed for storing 2D points, making it more intuitive to work with spatial data.iso3' columns.</p>"
